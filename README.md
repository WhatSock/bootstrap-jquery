AccDC Bootstrap for jQuery
=====

AccDC Bootstrap is an HTML parser that renders advanced, accessible interactive controls using semantic HTML markup.

Bootstrapping refers to the use of semantic HTML markup to configure advanced controls, which are then magically converted into dynamic interactive components when the content finishes loading.

This allows developers to include complex functionality that is fully configurable across thousands of web pages, without having to program individual components using JavaScript.

Benefits:

* Easy implementation
* Consistent layouts
* Reliable functionality
* Full customization
* Automatic accessibility

AccDC Bootstrap is module based, so it can be extended or reduced as needed for any site-wide implementation.

The style sheets for all bootstrap components are fully configurable, so they can be customized to fit the user interface design of any site while maintaining the same level of reliability and accessibility.

The bootstrap module itself is also fully configurable, so that new features and components can easily be added and customized for global integration.

All AccDC Bootstrap components are WCAG 2.0 compliant, ARIA standards compliant, and Section-508 compliant.

Tested using:

1. JAWS 11+&gt; using IE 8 and 9, and Firefox.
2. NVDA using IE 8 and 9, and Firefox.
3. Voiceover using iOS Safari.

AccDC Bootstrap is designed to automatically enforce accessibility, while making it possible to populate individual components with any type of content, in any language, using any visual styling.

Recursive processing is also supported, so that new content, when rendered, will automatically be bootstrapped; even when pulled from an external resource.

Bootstrapping can also be manually invoked using the $A.bootstrap method for individual DOM nodes.<br />

AccDC Bootstrap is distributed under the terms of the GNU LGPL.
