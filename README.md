AccDC Bootstrap 1.5 for jQuery (09/23/2013)
=====

AccDC Bootstrap is an HTML parser that renders advanced, accessible interactive controls using semantic HTML markup.

Supported by the Royal Society of Arts, AccDC was awarded the "Above and Beyond Accessibility Award" from the United States Department of Labor, and was presented at the Developing with Accessibility Event, hosted by the Federal Communications Commission in Washington DC in 2012.

This version of AccDC interfaces with jQuery as an extension.
All of the AccDC accessible component modules plug into this interface.

Bootstrapping refers to the use of semantic HTML markup to configure advanced controls, which are then magically converted into dynamic interactive components when the content finishes loading.

This allows developers to include complex functionality that is fully configurable across thousands of web pages, without having to program individual components using JavaScript.

Benefits:

* Easy implementation
* Consistent layouts
* Reliable functionality
* Full customization
* Automatic accessibility

AccDC Bootstrap is module based, so it can be extended or reduced as needed for any site-wide implementation.

The style sheets for all bootstrap components are fully configurable, so they can be customized to fit the user interface design of any site while maintaining the same level of reliability and accessibility.

The bootstrap module itself is also fully configurable, so that new features and components can easily be added and customized for global integration.

All AccDC Bootstrap components are WCAG 2.0 compliant, ARIA standards compliant, and Section-508 compliant.

Tested using:

1. JAWS 11+&gt; using IE 8 and 9, and Firefox.
2. NVDA using IE 8 and 9, and Firefox.
3. Voiceover using iOS Safari.

AccDC Bootstrap is designed to automatically enforce accessibility, while making it possible to populate individual components with any type of content, in any language, using any visual styling.

Recursive processing is also supported, so that new content, when rendered, will automatically be bootstrapped; even when pulled from an external resource.

Bootstrapping can also be manually invoked using the $A.bootstrap method for individual DOM nodes.<br />

Bootstrapped Modules
-----

Bootstrapping occurs using modules from the AccDC Component Library.

The AccDC Component Library is a collection of accessible control types that automate the structural and functional accessibility of each control according to relevant accessibility best practices. The controls can be populated with any type of content, and can be styled to fit any type of user interface layout, in any language, without negatively impacting accessibility. The controls tap into the accessibility features of the AccDC API to render content in an accessible manner, then apply supporting markup and scripting to automatically ensure accessibility for screen reader and keyboard only users. This makes it possible for developers to add fully customizable components, that look and feel exactly as they desire, while ensuring functional accessibility at the same time without the risk of coding misinterpretation by those who are unfamiliar with ATs. 

The following modules are included:

* Accessible Modal controls.
* Accessible Banner controls.
* Accessible Tooltip controls.
* Accessible Popup controls.
* ARIA Tab controls.
* ARIA context sensitive dropdown Menu controls. 
* ARIA Tree controls. 
* ARIA Date Picker controls. 
* Accessible Accordion controls. 
* Accessible Carousel, Slideshow, and Wizard controls.  
* Keyboard accessible Scrollable Div controls.  
* ARIA Toggle controls.    
* Accessible Footnote controls
