HAMLET
<br />
Do you see yonder cloud that's almost in shape of a camel?
<br />
POLONIUS 
<br />
By th' mass, and ’tis like a camel indeed.
<br />
HAMLET 
<br />
Methinks it is like a weasel.
<br />
POLONIUS 
<br />
It is backed like a weasel.
<br />
HAMLET 
<br />
Or like a whale.
<br />
POLONIUS 
<br />
Very like a whale.
